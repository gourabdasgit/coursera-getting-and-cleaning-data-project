CodeBook

This file includes the steps of the code run_analysis.R as well as the list of the variables.

Variables:

test/train: the downloaded data.
subject: assigned to each of the participants in the study (overall: 30)
activity: it is the action that the subject was taking when being tested. In this variable, different labels can be distinguished. walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.
features: the measurements used that include standard deviation, mean or frequency: tBodyAccMeanX, tBodyAccMeanY, tBodyAccMeanZ, tBodyAccStdX, tBodyAccStdY, tBodyAccStdZ, tGravityAccMeanX, tGravityAccMeanY, tGravityAccMeanZ, tGravityAccStdX, tGravityAccStdY, tGravityAccStdZ, tBodyAccJerkMeanX, tBodyAccJerkMeanY, tBodyAccJerkMeanZ, tBodyAccJerkStdX, tBodyAccJerkStdY, tBodyAccJerkStdZ, tBodyGyroMeanX, tBodyGyroMeanY, tBodyGyroMeanZ, tBodyGyroStdX, tBodyGyroStdY, tBodyGyroStdZ, tBodyGyroJerkMeanX, tBodyGyroJerkMeanY, tBodyGyroJerkMeanZ, tBodyGyroJerkStdX, tBodyGyroJerkStdY, tBodyGyroJerkStdZ, tBodyAccMagMean, tBodyAccMagStd, tGravityAccMagMean, tGravityAccMagStd, tBodyAccJerkMagMean, tBodyAccJerkMagStd, tBodyGyroMagMean, tBodyGyroMagStd, tBodyGyroJerkMagMean, tBodyGyroJerkMagStd, fBodyAccMeanX, fBodyAccMeanY, fBodyAccMeanZ, fBodyAccStdX, fBodyAccStdY, fBodyAccStdZ, fBodyAccMeanFreqX, fBodyAccMeanFreqY, fBodyAccMeanFreqZ, fBodyAccJerkMeanX, fBodyAccJerkMeanY, fBodyAccJerkMeanZ, fBodyAccJerkStdX, fBodyAccJerkStdY, fBodyAccJerkStdZ, fBodyAccJerkMeanFreqX, fBodyAccJerkMeanFreqY, fBodyAccJerkMeanFreqZ, fBodyGyroMeanX, fBodyGyroMeanY, fBodyGyroMeanZ, fBodyGyroStdX, fBodyGyroStdY, fBodyGyroStdZ, fBodyGyroMeanFreqX, fBodyGyroMeanFreqY, fBodyGyroMeanFreqZ, fBodyAccMagMean, fBodyAccMagStd, fBodyAccMagMeanFreq, fBodyBodyAccJerkMagMean, fBodyBodyAccJerkMagStd, fBodyBodyAccJerkMagMeanFreq, fBodyBodyGyroMagMean, fBodyBodyGyroMagStd, fBodyBodyGyroMagMeanFreq, fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagMean, fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagStd, fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagMeanFreq.
Code step by step:

The code used requires loading 'reshape' package.
Downloading the file and unziping it. Note: I am using Windows hence I do not need the 'method' argument in 'download.file'.
1.1. Storing the files in UCI HAR Dataset. Listing the downloaded files and storing them in 'files'.
Reading the files organized by labels: activity and features.
Extracting the data with the mean and standard deviation.
3.1. Loading the datasets for 'train': reading the tables by activity and subject.
3.2. Binding the data of subjects and activities and storing it in 't'.
3.3. Doing the same (as in steps 3.1. and 3.2.) for the 'test'. Storing the result in 't2'.
Merging the data of 't' and 't2'. Setting new labels in the newly created variable. Applying the function factor. Melting the data.
Creating the table for the new tidy data.
